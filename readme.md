A typeface based on directional signage found on Singapore's roads.

-----

## Overview

DA RoadSigns is a computer font created based on the typeface used on directional signs found on Singapore's road. 

## Usage notes

This typeface is not recommended for use at smaller font sizes - it has not been optimised for clarity or readability. It appears best when used at larger sizes, usually as white text on a dark-coloured background. 

**⚠️ Please note:** The typeface is based on <u>but not exactly the same</u> as provided in the document - some elements may be different, such as the ampersand symbol and the kerning around the comma symbol. 

### Glyphs

The following glyphs are currently included:
* Alpha-numeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
* Several common symbols
  * Ampersand `&`
  * Apostrophe `'`
  * Parenthesis, left and right `()`
  * Comma `,`
  * Dash `-`
  * Dot `.`
  * Forward slash `/`
  * Colon `:`

Future glyphs planned for inclusion includes basic arrows. 

### Metrics and spacing

![Vertical font metrics for DA RoadSigns](Docs/da-roadsigns-readme-metrics@2x.png)
* UPM: `1000`
* Ascender: `800`
* Cap height: `700`
* x-height: `500`
* Baseline: `0`
* Descender: -`200`

In other words, to get an x-height of 25mm, use a font size of 50mm (~142 pt), which will yield a cap-height of 35mm. 

The recommended vertical spacing between text in the SDRE is 20mm at an x-height of 25mm, which would equate to a line spacing of 120%. 

## Development notes

### Software

This font was produced using [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/), with letterforms created in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/) and exported as SVG. 

### References

The letterforms are based on the Land Transport Authority's standards for road signs, specifically [Standard Details of Road Elements, chapter 7 (LTA/SDRE14/7)](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/industry_innovations/industry_matters/development_construction_resources/street-work-proposals/codes_of_practice_standards_specifications_guides_and_forms.html).
