## Overview

**DA RoadSigns** is a font based on the typeface used on the directional signs found on Singapore's roads. 

## Usage notes

This typeface is not recommended for use at smaller font sizes - it has not been optimised for clarity or readability. It appears best when used at larger sizes, usually as white text on a dark-coloured background. 

**‚ö†Ô∏è Please note:** The typeface is based on **but not exactly the same** as the Land Transport Authority's road element standards - some elements may be different.

### Glyphs

The following glyphs are currently included:
* Alpha-numeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
* Several common symbols
  * Ampersand `&`
  * Apostrophe `'`
  * Parenthesis, left and right `()`
  * Comma `,`
  * Dash `-`
  * Dot `.`
  * Forward slash `/`
  * Colon `:`
* Several arrows (see note below)
  * Reduced-sized arrows
  * To-scale right arrow
  * To-scale downward-pointing lane arrow

Arrows are available for input using the usual emoji-input methods: [a preview is available here](https://roadsigns.dangeraspect.xyz/#arrows).

| Arrow type | Emoji | Unicode code point
|--|--|--
| Reduced-sized up arrow | ‚¨Ü | `U+2B06`
| Reduced-sized up-right arrow | ‚Üó | `U+2197`
| Reduced-sized right arrow | ‚û° | `U+27A1`
| Reduced-sized down-right arrow | ‚Üò | `U+2198`
| Reduced-sized down arrow | ‚¨á | `U+2B07`
| Reduced-sized down-left arrow | ‚Üô | `U+2199`
| Reduced-sized left arrow | ‚¨Ö | `U+2B05`
| Reduced-sized up-left arrow | ‚Üñ | `U+2196`
| Full-size right arrow | ‚ñ∂ | `U+25B6`
| Full-size downward lane arrow | üîΩ | `U+1F53D`

### Metrics and spacing

![Vertical font metrics for DA RoadSigns](Docs/da-roadsigns-readme-metrics@2x.png)

* UPM: `1000`
* Ascender: `800`
* Cap height: `700`
* x-height: `500`
* Baseline: `0`
* Descender: `-200`

In other words, to get an x-height of 25mm, use a font size of 50mm (~142 pt), which will yield a cap-height of 35mm. 

The recommended vertical spacing between text in the _Standard Details of Road Elements_ is 20mm at an x-height of 25mm, which would equate to a line spacing of 120%. 

## Development notes

### Software

This font was produced using [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/), with letterforms created in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/) and exported as SVG.
